# Breakout
A simple pygame project I made as a moderate challenge of yet another simple and retro game.
## Installation
First install Python with PIP in your machine.
Then install Pygame:
```
$ pip3 install pygame
```
Then clone this repo:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:GABETROLL/Breakout.git
$ cd Breakout/
```
## Usage
This repo comes with a prepared ``.exe`` for Windows. For Linux, you can run ``python3 main.py`` in the command line to play.
